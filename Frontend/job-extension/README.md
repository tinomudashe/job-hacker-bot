To use with the production app, update the `appUrl` in the extension settings.

## Permissions

The extension requires:

- **storage**: To save extracted job data temporarily
- **tabs**: To open the Job Hacker Bot app

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Extracting Data
- Make sure you're on a job listing page (not a search results page)
- Try refreshing the page and extracting again
- Check if the site is supported in the console logs

### Connection Issues
- Ensure the Job Hacker Bot app is running
- Check if you're signed in to the app
- Verify the app URL in extension settings

### Generated Content Not Appearing
- Make sure you're signed in to Job Hacker Bot
- Check that you have an active subscription
- Ensure your resume is set up in the app

## Development Notes

### Tech Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (matching app styles)
- Webpack for bundling
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3

### API Integration
The extension communicates with the Job Hacker Bot backend through:
- `/api/health` - Connection check
- `/api/extension/generate` - Content generation
- URL parameters for triggering the PDF dialog

### Key Files

## Contributing

When adding support for new job sites:
1. Add extraction logic to `extractDataFromPage()` in `App.tsx`
2. Test on multiple job listings from that site
3. Handle edge cases (missing fields, different layouts)
