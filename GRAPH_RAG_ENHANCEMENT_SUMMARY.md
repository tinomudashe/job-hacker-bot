### 2. **Smarter Agent Intelligence** (`backend/app/agent.py`)
- **Graph RAG Integration**: Agent now uses Graph RAG for intelligent form filling
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides job-specific information rather than generic responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates match confidence between user profile and job requirements
- **Intelligent Action**: New `get_smart_context` action uses Graph RAG for better decision-making

### 3. **Enhanced RAG Endpoints** (`backend/app/rag.py`)
- **Graph-Assisted RAG**: New endpoints that use Graph RAG for smarter assistance
- **Intelligent Job Application Context**: Provides comprehensive context for job applications
- **Agent Context Generation**: Generates intelligent instructions for the agent based on Graph RAG analysis

### 4. **Demo & Testing Infrastructure**

- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite to validate Graph RAG functionality
- **Status Monitoring**: Endpoints to check Graph RAG status and capabilities

## 🎯 Intelligence Capabilities Added

### **Before Graph RAG** (Traditional Approach)
- Simple keyword matching
- Basic user information retrieval
- Generic responses regardless of job context
- Limited understanding of relationships between skills and experience

### **After Graph RAG** (Intelligent Approach)
- ✅ **Relationship Understanding**: Connects Python → Backend Development → Software Engineering
- ✅ **Context Awareness**: Tailors responses based on specific job requirements
- ✅ **Skill Matching**: Intelligently maps user skills to job requirements
- ✅ **Experience Relevance**: Finds most relevant experience for specific roles
- ✅ **Confidence Scoring**: Provides likelihood of application success
- ✅ **Adaptive Communication**: Adjusts responses based on industry and role level

2. **Graph Edges**: Skill relationships, industry connections, experience mapping
3. **Embedding Model**: Google Text Embedding 004 for semantic understanding
4. **Vector Store**: InMemoryVectorStore for fast retrieval
5. **Traversal Strategy**: Eager strategy with depth-3 graph exploration

## 📋 New API Endpoints

### Graph RAG Demo Endpoints
- `GET /api/demo/graph-rag-status` - Check Graph RAG status and capabilities
- `POST /api/demo/graph-rag-search` - Demo intelligent search with job context
- `POST /api/demo/intelligent-application-context` - Show comprehensive job application context

### Enhanced RAG Endpoints
- `POST /api/rag/graph-assist` - Enhanced RAG assistance using Graph RAG
- `POST /api/rag/agent-context` - Get intelligent context for job application agent

## 🎮 How to Test the New Intelligence

### 1. **Check Graph RAG Status**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/demo/graph-rag-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. **Test Intelligent Search**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/demo/graph-rag-search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Python backend development experience",
    "job_description": "We need a Python developer with 3+ years experience in backend services"
  }'
```

### 3. **Test Job Application Context**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/demo/intelligent-application-context" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '"Software Engineer position requiring Python, AWS, and API development skills"'
```

## 🎯 Agent Behavior Changes

### **Enhanced Form Filling Strategy**
The agent now follows this intelligent process:

1. **Job Analysis**: Analyzes visible job requirements on the page
2. **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Uses Graph RAG to find relevant user information
3. **Smart Response Generation**: Provides job-specific answers rather than generic info
4. **Confidence-Based Decision Making**: Uses confidence scores to determine response quality
5. **Fallback Safety**: Falls back to basic information if Graph RAG is unavailable

### **New Agent Actions**
- `Get intelligent job-specific information using Graph RAG`: Provides context-aware responses
- Enhanced user information retrieval with job context understanding
- Automatic confidence scoring for application success likelihood

## 🔍 Intelligence Examples

### **Traditional Response** (Before)
- Question: "What are your relevant skills?"
- Answer: "Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js" (generic list)

### **Graph RAG Response** (After)
- Question: "What are your relevant skills?"
- Job Context: "Backend Python API development"
- Answer: "5+ years of Python backend development with expertise in REST API design, PostgreSQL databases, and AWS cloud infrastructure. Led development of scalable microservices handling 10k+ requests/minute." (contextually relevant with specific examples)

## 📈 Performance & Intelligence Metrics

- **Document Processing**: Enhanced metadata extraction from resumes/CVs
- **Search Accuracy**: Graph-based retrieval with relationship understanding
- **Response Relevance**: Job-specific rather than generic responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 scale for application success likelihood
- **Graph Traversal**: Up to 3-depth exploration with 8 result retrieval
