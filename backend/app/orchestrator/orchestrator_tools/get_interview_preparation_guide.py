TARGET ROLE: {job_title}
COMPANY: {company_name}

**CRITICAL: Analyze the user's CV/background and the job description to create questions that reference their SPECIFIC experience:**

Generate exactly 10 interview questions with sample answers. Return as JSON array:
[
    {{
    "question": "Tell me about yourself.",
    "answer": "Brief sample answer that the candidate could reference or build upon"
    }},

- 3 technical/role-specific questions
- 2 situational questions
- 1 company/culture fit question

**CV-SPECIFIC QUESTION EXAMPLES (adapt to their actual background):**
- "I see you were doing freelance work while working full-time at [Company]. How did you manage both responsibilities?"
- "You used [Technology] at [Company]. Can you walk me through how you implemented it?"
- "I notice you transitioned from [Previous Role] to [Current Role]. What motivated this change?"
- "You worked at [Company] for [Duration]. What was your biggest achievement there?"
- "I see you have experience with [Specific Skill/Technology]. How did you learn it and apply it?"
- "You've worked in both [Industry A] and [Industry B]. How do those experiences complement each other?"

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
1. Reference ACTUAL companies, technologies, roles from their background
2. Ask about career transitions, overlapping roles, technology choices
3. Question specific timeframes, gaps, or interesting patterns in their CV
4. Make questions sound like a real interviewer who studied their resume
5. Include follow-up style questions that dig deeper into their experience
