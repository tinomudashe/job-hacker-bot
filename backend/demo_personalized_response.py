    here's how to leverage YOUR specific skills for AI Engineering roles:
    
    üéØ YOUR Current Strengths to Highlight:
    ‚Ä¢ Python expertise (perfect foundation for ML) - emphasize your 3+ years
    ‚Ä¢ Backend API development (directly applicable to ML model serving)
    ‚Ä¢ Database optimization work (connects to big data processing)
    ‚Ä¢ Cloud deployment experience (great for MLOps pipelines)
    
    üöÄ Strategic Additions for YOUR Profile:
    ‚Ä¢ Add TensorFlow/PyTorch to your existing Python toolkit
    ‚Ä¢ Frame your Django REST API experience as "ML model deployment ready"
    ‚Ä¢ Connect your PostgreSQL optimization to "big data pipeline experience"
    ‚Ä¢ Highlight how your Git/Docker skills apply to MLOps workflows
    
    üí° Specific Next Steps Based on YOUR Background:
    1. Build a small ML project using your existing Python skills
    2. Deploy it using your current cloud deployment knowledge
    3. Create an API wrapper (you already know Django!) for model serving
    4. Document the MLOps pipeline you create
